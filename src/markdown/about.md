A set of library workers collaborated on the [public library data schemas](https://schema.librarydata.uk/). These were designed to help public library services publish open data.

Here are some resources about that project:

- DCMS blog - [Libraries and open data](https://dcmslibraries.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/06/libraries-and-open-data/)
- DCMS blog - [Open data - an update](https://dcmslibraries.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/03/library-open-data-an-update/)
- Frictionless Data blog - [Libraries Hacked](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/02/07/libraries-hacked/#schemas-and-frictionless-data) - a case study of using Table Schema to create a public library data schemas.

This website is to provide tools to use those schemas.

- Tools for publishing and validating data
- Visualisations from the data
- Data analysis techniques using the data.
- Data tools to aid in decision-making
