In 2019 a group of library services and data practioners convened to create a set of [public library data schema](https://schema.librarydata.uk/) that were designed for open data releases.

A more detailed [writeup of that project](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/02/07/libraries-hacked/#schemas-and-frictionless-data) is available as a case study on the Frictionless Data website.

This website was created to aid in following those data schemas, and in using the data produced from the compliant datasets. It includes:

* Tools that would help library services in creating those datasets.
* A means for collecting and updating those datasets and bringing them to the public.
* Visualisations of the data.
* A sharing of data analysis techniques using the data.
* Data tools that use the data to make decisions.
