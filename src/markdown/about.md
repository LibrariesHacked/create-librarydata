In 2019 a group of library service data practioners created a set of [public library data schema](https://schema.librarydata.uk/) that were designed for open data releases.

Some background about that project:

* DCMS Blog. [Libraries and open data](https://dcmslibraries.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/06/libraries-and-open-data/) and [Open data - an update](https://dcmslibraries.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/03/library-open-data-an-update/)
* Frictionless Data blog. [Case study of using Table Schema to create a public library data schema](https://frictionlessdata.io/blog/2022/02/07/libraries-hacked/#schemas-and-frictionless-data).

This website was created to aid in using those schemas, and the data produced from the datasets. It will include:

* Tools to help libraries create and maintain open data
* Visualisations of the data
* Sharing data analysis techniques using the data.
* Data tools that use the data to aid in decision-making
