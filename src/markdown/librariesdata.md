In the <a href="https://schema.librarydata.uk/libraries" target="_blank">**library locations dataset schema**</a>, a library is a static service point which provides access to library services for the general public. This does not include mobile libraries, which are covered in the mobile library stops dataset.

This tool allows you to view and edit the library service point data for libraries in the UK. These are grouped by library authority. The libraries dataset is a **register**. This means that to maintain it, the original data needs to be edited and kept up to date.

At the end of the process you can save a new copy of the data. If you are a member of the library service, you can replace the existing dataset, but ensure you [Log in](/login) before you begin.
