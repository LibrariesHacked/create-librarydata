A library is a static service point which provides access to library services for the public.

The libraries dataset is a **register**. This means that the original data needs to be permanently maintained and kept up to date.

This tool allows you to view and edit library service point data, grouped by local library authority. If making edits, at the end of the process you must then save a new copy of the data. If you have access rights you can **publish changes** to overwrite the existing data, but ensure you [Log in](/login) before you begin.
