A library is a static service point which provides library services for the public.

The libraries dataset is a **register**. This means that the data needs to be permanently maintained and up to date.

This tool allows you to view and edit library service points, grouped by local authority. To make changes you must first [Log in](/login). A the end of the process you must **publish changes** to ensure you overwrite the existing data.
