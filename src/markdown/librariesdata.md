A library is a static service point which provides library services for the public.

The libraries dataset is a **register**. This means that the data needs to be permanently maintained and kept up to date to create a single source of truth.

This tool allows you to view and edit library service points, grouped by local authority. To edit data, you must first [Log in](/login) before you begin. When making edits, at the end of the process you must **publish changes** to ensure you overwrite the existing data.
