A library member is any user registered with the library service. The user does not need to have borrowed a library item within any timescale to be considered a member. It is assumed inactive users are removed from the library system after an appropriate period of time, in accordance with General data protection regulations (GDPR).

The membership dataset is a **snapshot**. This means that each export is a single point in time representation of the data.
