A library member is any member of the public registered with the library service. They do not need to have borrowed an item within any timescale to be considered a member. It is assumed inactive users are removed from the library system after an appropriate period of time, in accordance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

The membership dataset is a **snapshot**. This means that each export is a point in time representation of the data.
