This tool displays library membership on a map to help explore areas of low/high membership, alongside other data such as deprivation statistics.

You need library membership data in the [membership data schema format](https://schema.librarydata.uk/membership). This can be created using the [postcode to statistical area converter](/postcode-to-lsoa).
