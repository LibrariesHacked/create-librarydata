This tool displays library membership on a map to help explore areas of low or high membership, alongside other data such as the socioeconomic deprivation of areas.

To use this tool you will need library membership data in the [membership data schema format](https://schema.librarydata.uk/membership). This can be created using the [postcode to statistical area converter](/postcode-to-lsoa).
