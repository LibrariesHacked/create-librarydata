England and Wales release statistics at the census-based 'lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'. This tool converts UK postcodes into the most appropriate area, for use in further analysis.

Postcodes are kept secure, and never published online.
