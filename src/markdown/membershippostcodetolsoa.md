This tool converts UK postcodes into statistical areas for further analysis. England and Wales store data at the census-based 'lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'.

All postcodes are stored securely on your own computer, and never published online.
