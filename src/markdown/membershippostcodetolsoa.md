This tool converts postcodes into statistical areas. These are useful for location-based analysis. England and Wales compile demographic data at census-based 'lower super output area' geographic areas. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'.

When using this tool, all postcodes are stored securely on your own computer, and never transmitted online.
