England and Wales release statistics at the census-based 'Lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland 'Small Areas'. This tool converts UK postcodes into the most appropriate area.

Postcodes are kept secure, and never published online. A selection of postcode to statistical area pairings are downloaded, based on the postcode <b>sectors</b> in your data. The correct areas are then selected on your local PC.
