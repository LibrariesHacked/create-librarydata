This tool converts UK postcodes into statistical areas. This is useful for then doing location based analysis. England and Wales compile demographic data at census-based 'lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'.

When using this tool, all postcodes are stored securely on your own computer, and never sent online.
