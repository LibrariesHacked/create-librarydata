This tool converts UK postcodes into statistical areas for further analysis. England and Wales store data at the census-based 'lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'.

Postcodes are kept secure, and never published online.
