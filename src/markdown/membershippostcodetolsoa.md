This tool converts UK postcodes into statistical areas, for use in further analysis. England and Wales release data at the census-based 'lower super output area' geographic level. In Scotland, 'Data Zones' are commonly used, and in Northern Ireland, 'Small Areas'.

Postcodes are kept secure, and never published online.
