A physical visit is an individual entering the library premises - for whatever reason. For co-located premises, this may mean counting visits that are not specifically for the purpose of using the library. Visit counts are often referred to as footfall.

Physical visits are a **time-series**. Data is maintained by adding new data (e.g. the next months visit counts).
