A physical visit is defined as an individual entering the library premises - for whatever reason. For co-located premises this may mean counting visits that are not specifically for using library services. This is often referred to as footfall.

The physical visits dataset is a **time-series**. Every time a new release is created it adds new data (e.g. the next months visits).
